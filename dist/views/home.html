XFac chats are in place, as well as designated 'ambassadors' to help resolve any small quarrels that may arise. <br> This sounds very serious and all and just to prove we aren't wearing our pants too tightly, we organise a monthly recurring event known as FS070. This brawl of beer and bursters takes place in a different location everytime so that even the regulars will find themselves in new situations everytime. We hand out unique prizes of high quality to the winning faction and agents who excel on an individual basis.<br> If you stumbled upon this site by accident and feel interested in joining either community, take a look at their respective recruitment sites below. </p> </md-card-content> <div class="md-actions" layout="row" layout-align="end center"> <md-button md-theme="enlightened" class="md-primary"> <a href="http://join-e.nl" target="_blank">Enlightened</a> </md-button> <md-button md-theme="resistance" class="md-primary"> <a href="http://theresistance.nl/" target="_blank">Resistance</a> </md-button> </div> </md-card> <md-card md-theme="{{theme}}" md-theme-watch> <img src="../images/IMG_20150606_193752.57066acc.jpg" class="md-card-image" alt="Ingress070 flyer"> <md-card-content> <h2 class="md-title">Team</h2> <p> The Ingress070 team currently consists of six members.
