On this day, anywhere from 20 to 70 agents gather up at a local cafe to enjoy a coffee, some food, friendly banter and an all out hardcore battle around the city.<br><br> The regular program looks like such:<br> <strong>10:00</strong> - Gather at the starting point<br> <strong>11:45</strong> - Final AP registration<br> <strong>12:00</strong> - Agents are dispersed for battle<br> <strong>13:00</strong> - Dead-drop location hints announced<br> <strong>14:00</strong> - All agents have returned<br> <strong>14:30</strong> - Winner announcement<br> <strong>>14:30</strong> - Agents are expected to rehydrate at this point<br> </p> </md-card-content> </md-card> <md-card> <img src="../images/IMG_20150307_172817.1e4d859c.jpg" class="md-card-image" alt="FS070 patches"> <md-card-content> <h2 class="md-title">Prizes</h2> <p> Every battle is finished with the sharing of loot and it's no different here. The winning faction claims ownership of the FS070 cup and is allowed to retain it for a month.<br> The cup is usually awarded to the highest ranking local agent in the winning faction.<br> We also hand out unique prizes to individual agents that occupy the 1st and 2nd place on the total AP score. These agents are awarded respectively the golden or silver FS patch. These were uniquely made for FS070 and are hard to come by, unless you want to try out your luck and win one yourself. </p> </md-card-content> </md-card> <md-card> <img src="../images/IMG_20150207_153226.ada922d2.jpg" class="md-card-image" alt="FS070 dead-drop"> <md-card-content> <h2 class="md-title">Dead-drops</h2> <p> Keep a close eye on the event page on G+ for the course of the event! Dead-drop location hints are known to get posted here.<br> In the past, those hints have ranged from pictures of the location itself to utterly complicated puzzles, but they all seem to lead to a secret stash of loot. </p> </md-card-content> </md-card>
